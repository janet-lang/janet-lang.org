The @code`os` module contains most Operating System specific functionality as well as routines
for interacting with the host OS. There is also some functionality for interacting with the
file system. The functionality in this module can be much reduced by setting the @code`JANET_REDUCED_OS`
define in @code`janetconf.h`.
