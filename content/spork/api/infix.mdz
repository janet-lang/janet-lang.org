A macro for infix syntax in Janet. Useful for math.

## Examples

@codeblock[janet]```
    ($$ a + b ** 2)            --->   (+ a (math/pow b 2))
    ($$ (a + b) ** 2)          --->   (math/pow (+ a b) 2)
    ($$ y[2] + y[3])           --->   (+ (in y 2) (in y 3))
    ($$ a > b and ,(good? z))  --->   (and (> a b) (good? z))
```

## Syntax

Syntax is as follows:

  Binary operators <<, >>, >>>, =, !=, <, <=, >, >=, &, ^, bor, band, and, or,
  +, -, *, /, %, ** are supported. Operator precedence is in the
  `precedence table below (higher means more tightly binding). All
  operators are left associative except ** (math/pow), which is right
  associative.

  Unary prefix operators !, -, bnot, not, ++, -- are supported.
  No unary postfix operators are supported.

  Square brackets can be used for indexing.

  Normal parentheses are used for making subgroups

  You can "escape" infix syntax use a quote or unquote (comma)
