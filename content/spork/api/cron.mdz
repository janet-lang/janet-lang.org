Timer library for interfacing with the UNIX crontab format. 

The cron format support is based on the unix cron syntax, with an optional seconds field. 
  Each field can be a comma separated list of individual values or a range of values. 

A range has three variants as follows: 
@ol{
  @li{Two values with a "-" between them, optionally followed by a "/" and a step value.}
  @li{An asterisk ("*") followed by a "/" and a step value. This implies every "step" value.}
  @li{A single value followed by a "/" and a step value. This implies every "step" value starting with the single value. I.e., 2/3 implies every 3 units from 2 to max units.}}

A single asterisk ("*") can be used to denote all possible values.

The fields:
@ul{
 @li{minutes: 0-5 }  
 @li{hours: 0-2 } 
 @li{day of month: 1-3 }  
 @li{month: 1-12. Also allowed are the following month codes in any case } 
   jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec
 @li{day of week: 0-7, where 0 or 7 is sunday, monday is 1, etc. allows the following day codes (any case)}  
   sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
 @li{ seconds (optional): 0-5}}

Cron schedules are represented as tuples of 7 values, a string representation, followed
by 6 bitmaps representing matching timestamps. Bitmaps are represented as any byte sequence.

@codeblock`[string-rep minutes hours day-of-month month day-of-week seconds]`

Note that we have second precision here as opposed to minute precision.
