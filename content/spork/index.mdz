Spork is a utility library for Janet. It contains a number of small
modules that should be useful for general programming in Janet but do
not "make the cut" for inclusion in the standard library. You can
think of spork as a sort of extended standard library for Janet.


## Source code

@p{@link[https://github.com/janet-lang/spork]}


## Install

@codeblock```
$ [sudo] jpm install spork
```

## Usage

Every binding in the spork library will be imported if you @code`(import spork)` in either a Janet source file or at a Janet REPL:

@codeblock```
Janet 1.35.2-fda0a081 linux/x64/gcc - '(doc)' for help
repl:1:> (import spork)
@{_ @{:value <cycle 0>} spork/argparse/argparse @{:private true} spork/base64/decode @{:private true} spork/base64/encode @{:private true} spork/crc/make-variant @{:private true} spork/crc/named-variant @{:private true} spork/cron/check @{:private true} spork/cron/next-timestamp @{:private true} spork/cron/parse-cron @{:private true} ...}
repl:2:>
```

However, it's usually more practical to only import the specific module you want using @code`(import spork/[module])`, replacing @code`[module]` as appropriate. For example:

@codeblock```
Janet 1.35.2-fda0a081 linux/x64/gcc - '(doc)' for help
repl:1:> (import spork/netrepl)
@{_ @{:value <cycle 0>} netrepl/client @{:private true} netrepl/default-host @{:private true} netrepl/default-port @{:private true} netrepl/server @{:private true} netrepl/server-single @{:private true}}
repl:2:>
```
